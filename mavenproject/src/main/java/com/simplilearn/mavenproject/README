***YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE ALL THE FILE PATHS CALLED IN THE CODE TO POINT TO CORRECT FILES***

my thought process:

0.1: made the machine class

0.2: made the item class

1: I need to handle the jason objects
			-> I used maven with:
							<dependency>
				    <groupId>com.googlecode.json-simple</groupId>
				    <artifactId>json-simple</artifactId>
				    <version>1.1.1</version>
					</dependency>
			-> I made fileJSONtoItemArray(String filename) method 
			   that takes in a json file's URL, reads the json object,
			   finds the "items" array from json object, and finally converts it to an 
			   array of items.

2: I made fillMachine(item[] input) --inserts the items into the vending machine sequentially.
			   
			
3: I wanted to focus on being able to display the machine
			-> i make checks on if the slot is empty or not and if it is empty i 
			   only print the count to give the machine its shape 
			-> Im sure there is a much better solution to displaying the machine
			
4: I built the main's while loop that takes user input
			-> I was unsure on how to take a JSON file as input so i just ask
			   for the file path and parse it similar to the initial input file

5: I need to create the transition() -this is called when its time for the customer to make a purchase
			-> takes payment
			     validate that its a dollar amount (double)
			-> they make a selection
			     i need to validate that their selection exist and is not empty
			->I decided that if a customer makes an invalid selection then the transaction
			  is canceled and their money is returned
			->I decided that if they select an item and it cost more then they put in
			  then the transaction is canceled and their money is returned.
			->did the final math for the transaction, set cost and payment back to 0, printed change

6: added logging statements
			->I could have definitely done this better but i was short on time
			->It logs the states of each transaction and notes if transaction was successful or canceled.
			->I added a date and time to each log

7: clean up and added comments
